CURRENT BUILD: Bukkit #2117
Since simple save is no longer available, I was looking for a nice simple way to back up my server maps with minimal configuration. Just set the folder and the interval, and your away. Most of the plugins I found had too many features for such a simple task (in my own opinion) so I decided to create this little plugin.

Basing my code of Banana Backup I began coding and threw this together.I am planning to change the way the plugin works to make it different in features from bananabackup. For the moment all that's different is the structure of the code and the way it saves the zip files, I also added in some more configuration options (and removed some as well)

What can I use this for?

Simple Backup is a plugin to zip up your minecraft server worlds to a folder so you can:

Let your users download them
Roll back your map
Plus more features as development goes on, but not too many because this is a simple plugin remember.

Providing error reports:

When pasting large ammounts of text please use http:pastebin.com. Its completely free and makes it easier for me to read any error messages you provide.

Also provide your SimpleBackup config file when stating you have a problem, so I can see if that's the problem instead.

Want to help me out?
