# Backup delete schedule
# For each interval a desired backup frequency is specified, for example:
# delete-schedule:
#    intervals:
#        - 3d
#        - 4w
#        - 6m
#    interval-frequencies:
#        - 1d
#        - 1w
#        - 0
# Translates to:
# for backups older than 3 days, leave only 1 backup per day;
# for backups older than 4 weeks + 3 days, leave only 1 backup per week;
# for backups older than 6 months + 4 weeks + 3 days, do not keep any;
# Supported symbols are ('h' = hour, 'd' = day, 'w' = week, 'm' = month, 'y' = year).
# Fractional numbers are not supported.
#
# true if a message should be broadcast when backup starts or ends
# broadcast-message: true
#
# Message tag shown in the chat when the server is backing up.
# Example: if the message was set to '[Bukkit is awesome]' you
# would see "[Bukkit is awesome] Starting Backup" when the
# plugin backs up
# backup-message: '[SimpleBackup]'
#
# The 'backup starting' message that is broadcast when backup starts
# custom-backup-message: Backup starting
