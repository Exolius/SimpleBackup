Configuring SimpleBackup is easy, just open the "config.yml" file and modify the settings in there, here's an example with some comments:

This configuration is the default one generated by SimpleBackup.

# Interval between map saves in hours, 0.25 is 15 minutes, 1.0 is 1 hour and so on. (1 hour is default).
backup-interval-hours: 1.0

# Message tag shown in the chat when the server is backing up.
# Example: if the message was set to '[Bukkit is awesome]' you 
# would see "[Bukkit is awesome] Starting Backup" when the 
# plugin backs up
backup-message: '[SimpleBackup]'

# Worlds to back up, add more on a new line like so: - WORLD_NAME_HERE
backup-worlds:
- world
- world_nether
- world_the_end

# Date format of the filename, it is set for "YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HOUR-MINUTE-SECOND".
backup-date-format: yyyy-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss

# Interval between different world saves, It will wait X milliseconds before zipping the next world (If more than one world is specified).
interval-between: 100

# The folder used by the plugin, defaults to the server.jar location.
# So "backups/" would make a folder in the same location as 
# the server.jar
backup-file: backups/

# Choose to broadcast the backup message in the chat.
broadcast-message: true

#If set to true, the plugin wont backup every time you restart the server.
delay-first-backup: true
