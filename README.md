CURRENT BUILD: Bukkit 1.12
================================
**Should work on 1.7-1.12**

Since simple save is no longer available, I was looking for a nice simple way to back up my server maps with minimal configuration. Just set the folder and the interval, and your away. Most of the plugins I found had too many features for such a simple task (in my own opinion) so I decided to create this little plugin.

**What can I use this for?**

Simple Backup is a plugin to zip up your minecraft server worlds to a folder so you can:

Let your users download them
Roll back your map
Plus more features as development goes on, but not too many because this is a simple plugin remember.

**Providing error reports:**

When pasting large amounts of text please use [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com). Its completely free and makes it easier for me to read any error messages you provide. You can even set it as a private paste so only people with the link can view it.

Also provide your SimpleBackup **config file** when stating you have a problem, so I can see if that's the problem instead.

**Want to help me out?**

You can donate to SimpleBackup if you love the plugin to bits and want to show me some support by clicking the donate button in the top right of the [Bukkit Dev](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/simplebackup) page. 

Don't want to or can't donate?, then just leave a comment showing me support instead!


Thanks for any support you give me, and enjoy simple backup!


Thanks to Mantun for improving the source code and adding more features and bugfixes!
